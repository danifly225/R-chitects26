# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript in Vite build environment
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui components for consistent design system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming, featuring premium orange accent color and neutral grays
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for type-safe form schemas
- **Component Structure**: Modular component architecture with separate sections (Hero, Excellence, Projects, Team, Services, Contact, Footer)

## Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Design**: RESTful API with JSON responses
- **Data Storage**: In-memory storage with interface-based storage abstraction (IStorage)
- **Request Handling**: Express middleware for JSON parsing, CORS, and request logging
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error middleware with structured error responses
- **Development**: Vite integration for hot reloading and development server

## Database Schema
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect configuration
- **Tables**: 
  - `users` table with UUID primary keys, username/password fields
  - `contact_messages` table for form submissions with fields for name, email, phone, project type, message, and timestamps
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime validation matching database schema types
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with inferred types from schema definitions

## Form Processing
- **Contact Form**: Multi-field form with name, email, phone (optional), project type (optional), and message
- **Validation**: Client-side validation with React Hook Form and server-side validation with Zod
